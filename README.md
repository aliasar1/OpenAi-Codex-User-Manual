# OpenAi-Codex-User-Manual üìù

This repository has the user manual for OpenAi Codex where we researched about what exactly AiCodex is and how it works. We also demonstrated how to use a JavaScript Sandbox where we can write instructions and it will be drawn on the screen to visualize it. We created a small web page of Shopping website to play around with the JavaScript Sandbox. We have also discussed ChatGPT which is the trending product of OpenAi Codex and is gaining much popularity.

### Here is the end product we build using JavaScript Sandbox:
